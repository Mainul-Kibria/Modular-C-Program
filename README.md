# Modular-C-Program
This C++ program is for Understanding the basics of  how modular programs are made simplly.
This program takes input from the console continuously and outputs the message after printing "You entered :" follwed by 
the message and some other text from the initializer module's constructor and destructor just for fun.It's useless.
So,to terminate the program you can write "close" or "x" (small x) or "exit".
Thats all for this program.it does nothing more.
